## Interactive web UI with C#
Blazor lets you build interactive web UIs using C# instead of JavaScript.
Blazor apps are composed of reusable web UI components implemented using C#, HTML, and CSS. Both client and server code is written in C#, allowing you to share code and libraries.

## Built on open web standards
Blazor uses open web standards without plug-ins or code transpilation.
Blazor works in all modern web browsers, including mobile browsers.

Code running in the browser executes in the same security sandbox as JavaScript frameworks.

## Share code and libraries
Blazor apps can use existing .NET libraries, thanks to .NET Standard, a formal specification of .NET APIs that are common across all .NET implementations.

.NET Standard allows the same code and libraries to be used on the server, in the browser, or anywhere you write .NET code.

## JavaScript interop
Your C# code can easily call JavaScript APIs and libraries.
You can continue to use the large ecosystem of JavaScript libraries that exist for client side UI while writing your logic in C#.
